<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<div class="">
The urban renewal case in Xin Zhuang district surprised many FJU students when the government announced it. Itâ€™s not because the campus will be torn down but because the small night market located at the back of the campus is included in the renewal plan. For many students, the small night market is not only a place for buying meals but also a place for making friends with those vendors and further creating more stories. In this case, this lesson is designed for junior and senior students in FJU, who have more memories on the campus and are going to graduate soon, to make them reflect on the memories on the campus, especially in the small night market. Moreover, the activities in the lesson plan can help them improve their listening, reading, and writing skills.
